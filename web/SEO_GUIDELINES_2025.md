SEO Generation Guidelines (2025)

Titles
- Length: aim 50–60 characters (cap 65, min 30)
- Intent-first: reflect informational/transactional/local intent
- Primary keyword once near the beginning; natural language
- Use Title Case; avoid ALL CAPS, clickbait, and emoji
- Add specific modifiers where relevant (year, location, product type, benefit)
- If brand is present, place at end after a separator (– or |)
- Ensure each title is unique across ideas/pages

Meta Descriptions
- 150–160 characters; match search intent and page content
- Include primary keyword once near the start (natural phrasing)
- Communicate benefit/differentiator + clear, subtle CTA
- Avoid quotes, emojis, and keyword stuffing; no line breaks
- Unique per page; do not duplicate across pages

Image Alt Text
- 8–14 words; describe the image precisely for accessibility
- Include the primary keyword phrase exactly once if relevant
- Avoid “image of / photo of”, brand names (unless essential), and trailing punctuation
- Do not stuff keywords; prefer concrete nouns and attributes

General
- Respect existing H1 and content; keep language consistent with page
- Prefer clarity and specificity over broad statements
- Avoid duplication across title/meta/alt for the same page
